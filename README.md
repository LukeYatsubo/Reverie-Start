# Reverie-Start
Repository of code from my independent Unity Project, titled Reverie
This code isn't designed to work on its own, but rather as a quick showcase of some code that I was happy with. 
For a deeper understanding/ clearer context of this code, email me for the project folder of Reverie Start and you can both play the demo and look through what I've done.
